<em>Vision, Mission, and Values<em>

We are Spiraldot Health. Our vision is to empower the healthcare ecosystem to provide better care. Our tagline is “Defeat Disease with Data™”

Our mission is to dramatically improve providers' clinical diagnosis by elevating them through technology, freeing them to focus on actual care and not tools or tech.

We will accomplish this mission through our ability to compose unique and compelling ways to organize, make accessible, analyzing what is most actionable, share and show clinical data to providers by putting patients first, embracing existing workflows as a crucial part of operations, and designing our systems to be usable by all people in a very consumer friendly way. 
Our Values

How we accomplish our mission matters. Our values describe the sorts of behavior and attitudes we encourage above and beyond professional norms.
We treat each other, our customers, and suppliers with respect, compassion, and empathy.
We are curious. We experiment, learn, and strive for mastery. We do not settle, though we may compromise. We do not rest on our laurels, though we may pause.
We are honest and plain-spoken. We say what we mean and do what we say in all regards whether building, marketing, selling, implementing, or supporting.
We are action-oriented. We would rather take a calculated risk, make a mistake, and quickly self-correct than to be frozen in analysis.
We are tenacious. We play the long game. We expect valleys. We can focus and persevere in the face of setbacks and short-term challenges.
We are diverse in thought, backgrounds, experience and encourage multiple points of view, and engage in spirited (but polite) debate. However, once settled, we all row in the same direction.
We hire
People who are passionate about our mission and share “Our Values”.
People who are on a great career trajectory.
People who will expand our collective skill set and/or challenge our thinking.
People who will add our culture, not necessarily fit or conform to it.
We promote
People who show a passion for lifelong learning, master their domain, build up their colleagues, and become a go-to resource.
People who are productive, and foster an environment of enabling and supporting others..
People who balance challenging their team with being loved by their team.
People who proactively identify and own problems; and create solutions improving themselves, their team, and the company.
People who set audacious goals, and then hit them, or fail but learn and are willing to try again.
We fire
People who consistently or egregiously violate “Our Values”.
People who gossip, spread negativity, or amplify FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). There may be times when you are unhappy. Talk to your manager and work toward improving the situation; don’t bring down others.
People who do not master their domains, lack the ability to recognize it, and are unwilling to put in the work to improve.
When you are a leader
You are a force multiplier. Your actions are amplified, so we have even higher expectations of you!
Lead from the front, not from the rear. Roll up your sleeves and show what an amazing individual contributor can do. If your team doesn’t know the answer, your job is to help figure it out.
Encourage and curate ideas. You don’t need to (and probably won’t) always have the best ideas. Your team should feel good about sharing. You need to listen, synthesize, and find the best ideas.
Mentor people, and always act in ways to build them up. Know their challenges and help clear obstacles so that they can shine.
If there’s no obvious right answer (and there seldom is), make a decision. Take the blame if it proves to be wrong, and share the credit if it proves to be correct.
If no one else on your team can, wants to, or should do the job, it’s your job.

Strategy to accomplish our mission

As a startup (or really, any agile company), we are always conducting experiments, making adjustments, and moving closer to achieving that product-market fit. As a result, our strategy reflects a particular point-in-time and will likely evolve over time.

Our current strategy is:
Build MVP for Readmission and Adverse events to demonstrate early ROI and product market fit
Focusing on AI and ML where it makes sense to to add significant business value
Raise money to have the runway to make mistakes and refocus if necessary 
Have a fucking good time, working with great people doing something meaningful
